**比特币：点对点的电子数字货币**

文章主要通过阅读比特币白皮书去翻译书中内容以及做一系列理解


>抽象地来说，一个点对点的电子数字货币允许线上交易从一个账户直接发送到另一个账户而不需要经过金融机构。数字签名提供了解决方案的一部分，但如果仍然需要受信任的第三方来防止双重支付，则主要的好处就会丢失。我们提出一种解决双重支付的方案---点对点网络。时间戳将线上交易散列到基于hash的工作证明链中。最长的链不仅仅是交易的证明，也说明来源于最大的矿池。当大部分算力由不协作的节点提供，就会产生最长链和算力攻击者。网络本身需要最小的结构。消息是在尽力而为的基础上广播的，节点可以随意离开并重新加入网络，接受最长的工作证明链作为它们消失时发生的事情的证据

#### 前言

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.
What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

互联网商业越来越依赖金融机构作为受信任的第三方来处理线上交易。
